The architecture for this simple HTML random number generation website will consist of three main parts:

1. HTML file (index.html): This is the main entry point of the website. It will contain the HTML structure of the website and a script tag to link to the JavaScript file.

2. JavaScript file (main.js): This file will contain the logic for generating the random number and updating the HTML page with the new number.

3. CSS file (styles.css): This file will contain the styles for the website.

Let's start with the HTML file:

index.html
